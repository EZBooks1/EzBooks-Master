         &emsp;This website is intended to act as an additional tool for an
         existing college class registration system, to simulate this,
         we ask all users to select a major when they register for our website.
         The major you choose will then be used to randomly generate a mock
         class schedule for you. This mock schedule is a key element in order
         to demonstrate the true functionality of our website.
      </p>

   <div class="help-info">
      <p>
         &emsp;After registering for our website, you will be shown your
         generated schedule, and given the option to regenerate your schedule
         if you wish. Once you confirm your schedule, you will be taken to the
         book selection page. Each book on this page is gathered according to the
         textbook needs of the classes in your schedule. Here you can choose to
         remove any books which you may already own, or have chosen to purchase
         elsewhere. You also have the option to rent or buy both new or used textbooks.

         &emsp;Once you finish choosing which textbooks to order, you will be
         brought to the checkout page. On this page you will be asked to fill in the
         delivery or pickup information. After choosing your purchasing preferences,
         your textbooks will be on their way, either to the pickup location or directly to
         your dorm room!
